Startup Health Scoring Model
This project simulates a startup scoring system — like a credit score for startups.

-What It Does
It assigns a score out of 100 to each startup based on:

Team experience

Market size

Active users

Burn rate (inverted)

Funds raised

Valuation

- How It Works
All data is normalized (0–1)

Burn rate is inverted (lower is better)

Each metric is weighted based on importance

A final score is calculated and startups are ranked

-Results
Top startups have high users, big market, and low burn

Visuals: bar chart of scores, heatmap of correlations

 Tech Used
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
